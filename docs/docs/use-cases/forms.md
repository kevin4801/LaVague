# Fill out forms

LaVague can be used to fill out simple forms automatically! Just provide the necessary information and ask LaVague to fill event registration forms, job applications, etc. 

We have created a [sample job application form](https://form.jotform.com/241472287797370) you can use to try this use case. 

Here is our framework going through the form and filling it after being given the instruction: **"Fill out this form, my name is: John Doe, my email is john.doe@gmail.com, etc..."**.

On the left, you can see our agent navigating and highlighting the next elements to be interacted with. On the right, the reasoning and the low level instructions generated for our Action Engine (which controls the browser). 

## Try it yourself

After [installation](../get-started/quick-tour.md), create a new .py file and run this code to try LaVague with Notion!

```python
from lavague.core import ActionEngine, WorldModel
from lavague.core.agents import WebAgent
from lavague.drivers.selenium import SeleniumDriver

selenium_driver = SeleniumDriver()
action_engine = ActionEngine(selenium_driver)
world_model = WorldModel()
agent = WebAgent(world_model, action_engine)
agent.get("https://form.jotform.com/241472287797370")

data = """
- job: product lead
- first name: John
- last name: Doe
- email: john.doe@gmail.com
- phone: 555-123-4567
- cover letter: Excited to work with you!
"""

instruction = "Use the necessary data provided to fill in the form."
agent.run(instruction, user_data=data)
```

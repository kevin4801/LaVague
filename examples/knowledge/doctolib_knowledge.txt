Thoughts:

- The current screenshot shows search results for pediatricians in Lyon Part-Dieu.
- The objective is to find the first pediatrician available in October 2024 and try to book an appointment as a new patient.
- The page has been scanned, so we have a full view of the available pediatricians.
- We see that in one of the screenshots there is a pediatrician available on October 10th.
- We should therefore learn more about her schedule to see if she is available for taking appointments with new patients.
